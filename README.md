# Discord Soccer Lineup Bot
This discord bot allows users to enter player names delimited by comma and semi-colons which are then converted to a soccer lineup format. The semi-colons create seperate lines like the difference between defence, midfield, and attack.

The bot has been written in Python and uses the Discord Bot API.
